# Public Counter

You can use my public MoonCounter instance. But I don't have responsibility for its stablility. In fact, no one does. But as long as my blog website continues, the counter service is always public.
But i still recommand you self-host your owned service.

**Ofc, the use of my service is prohibited for illegal websites.**

## Image Counter

**Replace the UniqueID parameter with the webpage's url. At least it must be unique to identify your page.**

```
![](https:///counter.moonlab.top/counter/img?id=UniqueID)

<img src="//counter.moonlab.top/counter/img?id=UniqueID"></img>
```

If you don't wanna handle UniqueID by yourself, you can use this. It will automatically handle the id param. You can just directly put it on your webpage to count.

```
<script src="//counter.moonlab.top/moon-counter/js/img"></script>
<img id="moon-counter-img"></img>
```

## Text Counter

And this will only output plain count text. You also don't need to handle the uniqueid parameter by yourself.

```
<script src="//counter.moonlab.top/moon-counter/js"></script>
<span id="moon-counter"></span>
```
